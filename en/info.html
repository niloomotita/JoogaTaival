                       <p>I founded JoogaTaival (which means Yoga Trek in Finnish) in January 2015. Initially it allowed me to teach yoga part-time alongside my job as a Finnish language instructor. My final decision to devote myself to the yoga path and nature came about at the time when cherry trees were blossoming and frogs were mating in spring 2016. May was exceptionally warm, offering me the chance to develop my ideas and to begin to turn my dreams into reality.</p>

The frog can be seen as a symbol of transformation, fertility, hidden beauty, healing and creativity. The frog has a very keen sense of sight and hearing and the power to leap far, feeling at home on land and in the water alike. The Japanese often take a frog with them on a journey to bring them luck and to guarantee a safe return. I hope Sakura brings luck and well-being to me and you, my partner on my journey.</p>

                            <p> Cherry blossoms and frog mating festivals in the spring are just two beautiful examples of nature's gifts to us. Colours, sounds, experiences, silence, intoxicating smells, nourishment, growth, opportunities to reconnect to yourself and find something new around you, endless beauty... We can see the most amazing things and details when we boldly go out on a trip in nature and are prepared to stop, listen and sense everything around us. Various studies show that nature can work miracles on our health. 60% of people's most favourite places are in nature. Moving about in nature raises your spirits and increases your psychological well-being. Even a 20-minute walk in nature can reduce your stress hormones and relax your mind.

                        <p>We need a relationship to nature and our environment – nature gives to us and similarly nature needs us. We are part of nature, which is something we sometimes forget in today's hectic world. The air we breathe and the water we drink flow endlessly between us and nature. Our choices and small deeds and exercising while respecting nature can have a profound impact on preserving the diversity and beauty of nature. According to eco-psychology, humans' and nature's well-being (or lack of it) go hand in hand. Our current times demand that we remain good friends with nature. Each and every one of us can make a small or big promise to nature that we will do small eco-deeds in our daily lives and raise our children to respect a rich and clean nature. When nature's doing well, you're doing well!</p>

                <p>I'm a 37-year-old nature-loving, creative and positive woman. My soul landscape is in the holiday setting of my childhood in Suomussalmi in Kainuu, where my mother was born. It was in Suomussalmi, and especially in Hossa, our new national park, where my love for and connection to nature were born and deepened. At the moment, I feel it is my mission to share the empowering effects of nature and yoga with others.</p>

In addition to regularly practising yoga, I have been to several meditation and yoga retreats and courses. Yoga and meditation have given me the tools to manage the stress and pressures of work, to deepen my self-knowledge and gain a lot of self-confidence and calmness in my life, as well as the courage to build a good way of living.</li>

        <p>The aim of mindfulness, or conscious accepting presence, is to develop the ability to bring one's attention to experiences and feelings occurring in the present moment, to encounter oneself with empathy and to be constructive about one's experiences – to be firm and gentle at the same time. Mindfulness helps you deal confidently with the challenges of daily life without surrendering to sources of stress or your fears.</br>Practising your awareness skills and presence, listening to your feelings and accepting and respecting your limitations are also an integral part of yoga. Mindfulness yoga is a calm form of hatha yoga where you listen to your body and mind. Yin yoga, which focuses on long, deep stretches, works towards the same goals as mindfulness yoga: to stop, listen, breathe, sense the moment, increase awareness and relax. </br >At the physical level, yoga strengthens the body and makes it more flexible and balanced. This can, for example, relieve pain in the neck and shoulder area, give you better control over the centre of your body and improve the quality of your sleep. Yoga is suitable for everybody, regardless of how much you have exercised. We use various props that help make the exercises as pleasant as possible for all participants. In mindfulness yoga, it is important to have plenty of time and that the atmosphere is safe, calm and open. Every exercise has a theme that we focus on, such as breathing, meditation or a movement exercise that focuses on a group of muscles or certain body part.</p>

Mindfulness helps you deal confidently with the challenges of daily life without surrendering to sources of stress or your fears. </br>When practising your awareness skills and presence, listening to your feelings and accepting and respecting your limits, other people and the environment play an important role. Once your awareness skills develop, communication with others may well become smoother and richer. Eco-mindfulness adds nature as an important element to mindfulness exercises. Humans are seen as part of nature – when nature feels well, we feel well and vice versa.</br>In eco-mindfulness, nature elements can be brought indoors to provide imagery for exercises, or exercises can be done in nature, for example in a forest, park or other place that helps you relax and be aware of your presence. The sessions can include various exercises that open up and deepen your connection with nature, stimulate your senses and improve your self-knowledge. The exercises are based on eco-psychological and therapeutic methods. There are plenty of studies on the therapeutic effect of nature and they indicate that nature helps people relax and find calmness, reducing stress and mental health problems. That's why nature is one of the best places to practise eco-mindfulness.</p>

        <p>Green care consists of activities in nature and rural environments that improve people's well-being and quality of life. Green care includes many different types of methods for increasing people's wellbeing with the help of animals and nature. These include horse riding therapy, garden therapy and activities, social pedagogic activities with horses and eco-psychology methods. The activities are carried out in a responsible, professional and goal-oriented way. Well-being increases through the therapeutic effects of nature, participation and experiences.</br>Green care can be divided into two service types: nature care and nature power. Nature care consists of various care and rehabilitation, activating social work and social pedagogy, and education methods. Nature power focuses more on nature-aided recreational and well-being activities. In social pedagogy and education it also focuses on various hobbies practised in nature, for example. What is essential in both nature care and nature power is green well-being, in other words, nature-based methods that bring well-being to people, animals and nature.</p>

        <p>Drama education is a learning method that combines various participatory, playful, narrative, theatrical and conversational means. Drama allows you to experience and experiment with all kinds of feelings, thoughts and expressions that you would not necessarily encounter in your daily life. At its best, it can be lots of fun and very profound, and it is suitable for all kinds of learners. Drama allows people to gain experiences that expand their views on culture, society, themselves and other people. Drama is a means for studying various things. Making drama together with a group improves people's social, emotional and empathy skills.</br>Eco-drama is based on the methods and values of drama education. The themes dealt with in eco-drama are always somehow related to nature and the environment. Eco-drama can be a very effective and exciting environmental education method that can give you ideas and information on your personal relationship with nature, the diversity of nature, sustainable development and environmental protection. In other words, eco-drama is a way to study and learn about nature and yourself.</p>
